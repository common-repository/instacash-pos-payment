It's InstaCash's point of sale loan solution for Woocommerce payment.
Based on the amount to be paid, the customer can start a request to finance their purchase in the InstaCash system.


== Description ==

A payment service gateway to Woocommerce webshops that allows a customer to initiate a short online loan application to cover a purchase.

From the available online offers of the InstaCash Application, we get a calculated amount based on which we can start the application process.
